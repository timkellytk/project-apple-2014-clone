# HTML and CSS Clone - Apple 2014 Homepage

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients)

The project is a clone of the [Apple 2014 homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) using HTML, SASS and Bootstrap 4. The SASS is written using BEM with PascalCasing, as recommended in the [Airbnb CSS / SASS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

The website uses background-image, background-position and background-size to achieve gradient backgrounds and to position images within div blocks.
